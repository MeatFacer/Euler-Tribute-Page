        Leonhard Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics. Some of his contributions to science include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fouding the field of graph theory. By studying the problem known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg" target="_blank">Seven Bridges of KÃ¶ningsberg</a> Euler kickstarted the field of Graph Theory.</li>
        <li>The well known mathematical constant <em>e</em> is named after Euler. </li>
        <li>Euler proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges.</li>
        <li>In Physics, Euler helped develop the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.</li>
        <li>In astronomy his accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the sun.</li>
      </ul>
